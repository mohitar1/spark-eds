# Cards

Displays content in a grid of card layouts with images and text. Cards automatically become clickable when they contain links.

## When to Use

- Showcasing collections, brands, or categories
- Navigation grids linking to different sections
- Feature highlights with images
- Content teasers with thumbnails

## Authoring

### Basic Structure

| cards |  |
|-------|--|
| image.jpg | Card Title |
| image-2.jpg | Another Card Title |

### Content Structure

| Column | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| First column | Card image |
| Second column | Card title/text (can include a link) |

Each row becomes one card. Add as many rows as needed.

### Making Cards Clickable

To make a card clickable, add a link to the text in the second column:

| cards |  |
|-------|--|
| image.jpg | [Card Title](/path/to/page) |

The entire card becomes clickable, not just the text.

## Variants

| Variant | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| (default) | Horizontal cards with image on left, gray background |
| `(highlights)` | Vertical cards with image on top, dark background, red hover effect |
